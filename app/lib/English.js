It has been a permanent feature in<br />Van Cleef & Arpels’ watchmaking collections ever since. In the early 20th century, it was considered inelegant for a woman to wear a watch or to look at the time in public.

The flowers can also be worn alone as lapel clips.The piece created evokes the aesthetics of its time.

It epitomizes the theme of nature, dear to<br /> Van Cleef & Arpels, as well as its famous Mystery Set technique. This dazzling invention has been associated with <br />Van Cleef & Arpels ever since the Maison patented it in 1933. It consists in setting stones in such a way that no prongs are visible. The level of expertise required makes of the Mystery Set technique the exclusive preserve of a very small number of Mains d’Or, virtuoso craftsmen of the Maison’s workshops. Each faceted stone is delicately inserted into thin gold rails less than two-tenths of a millimeter thick. Once the piece is complete, the gems appear to be entirely free-standing. Because of the complexity of the process, Mystery Set pieces are extremely rare: the Maison produces no more than a few of them each year.At first, the Mystery Set technique was reserved for pieces with flat surfaces such as boxes. But as the technique developed, Van Cleef & Arpels began using it on more complex shapes with varying degrees of volume.The curved petals of this clip are made of Mystery Set rubies, while its center is set with circular-cut diamonds. The stem is composed of graduated baguette-cut diamonds with two diamond-set leaves. It is mounted on gold and platinum.",

Its shapes, designs, themes and taste for fluted and brightly colored gemstones were reflected in the art of Van Cleef & Arpels. Furthermore, the Maharajas of India’s princely states – which included Rajpipla, Kapurthala and Indore – were all loyal customers of <br />Van Cleef & Arpels, with a profound love for France, its culture and its art de vivre. In the 1960s and 1970s, precious jewelry of Indian inspiration attained new summits of beauty and finesse. The popularity of the paisley motif – which originated in Kashmir – was revived by an Englishman named Arthur Liberty. Paisley became well-known as the Liberty print and was used for interior accessories. This pattern was also very popular in jewelry design. Dating from 1966, this Paisley clip is made of a floral cluster set with cushion-shaped rubies within a field of diamonds, enhanced by rubies and diamonds. It is mounted on yellow gold.",

            "Detail_content":"The artistry, the multicoloured jewelry and the extravagantly baroque designs of India have exerted one of the best-loved influences on Van Cleef & Arpels’ creations. Since the 1920’s, an exotic Indian flavor has been present in many High Jewelry collections.Ever since the Art Deco era, this aesthetic has enticed Van Cleef & Arpels onto the road to the Orient and the world of the Thousand and One Nights. Claude and Pierre Arpels (of the second generation of the Arpels family) were frequent visitors to India in search of the finest precious stones. Dating from 1973, the Panka necklace is made of round and oval-shaped turquoise cabochons and round diamonds mounted in yellow gold. The combination of precious and ornamental stones and the shape of the necklace epitomize the oriental style.",

The daring that typified 1970s fashion was also found in jewelry design. While precious stone jewelry remained the realm of the privileged few for whom <br/>Van Cleef & Arpels distinguished itself with brio, precious metal jewelry gradually broke free of traditional references to make its own mark. Transformable jewelry was more fashionable than ever: the necklace created for Prince Aga Khan in 1971 could be converted into a clip and bracelets."

Mounted on yellow gold and platinum, it is made of mauve jade and decorated with blooming roses set with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires. The edges are detailed in black and green enamel and rose-cut diamonds.In the 1920’s, vanity or beauty cases were among the accessories of the elegant and stylish lady. They housed the various objects a woman needed to maintain her well-groomed allure: a mirror, a powder compartment, a lipstick holder, a pill or handkerchief box and a dance card. The cover of this Roses vanity case from 1926 is a miniature in the Art Deco style. Exalting flowers, it is emblematic of the Maison’s Art Deco period, which began in 1924 and culminated in 1925.",

Art Nouveau gave way to the pared down lines of Art Deco. While harmonies of black and white were used in chatelaine watches in the post-war period, diamond jewelry dominated the Maison’s production after 1925. The return to color was echoed in high jewelry. In parallel with the geometric forms of the new aesthetic, naturalistic subjects continued to play an important part in the Maison’s history."

Also known as the “Autumn Flower”, it was believed to have the power of life because of its ability to flourish in cold winds. The chrysanthemum was introduced to the West in the 18th century by Karl Linnaeus, the renowned Swedish botanist. During the 19th and 20th centuries, fashion designers reinterpreted the shapes and motifs of Chinese art, including that of the chrysanthemum. The Mystery Set technique combines the skills of precision lapidary work with meticulous stone setting and a jewelry expertise that can only come from years of work. It requires experience, patience and a “master’s touch”. The Chrysanthemum clip features curved petals set with Mystery Set rubies – 835 of them weighing 140 carats – and diamond scrolling lines containing 111 diamonds weighing 10.89 carats. The mounting is in platinum and yellow gold.",

The closure system was first used for aviators’ jackets and sailors’ uniforms, before being appropriated by the fashion world, notably by Elsa Schiaparelli who first made them visible on dresses. The 1930s  were the time when women were defying conventions to reach an ideal of independence and freedom. It was said that the Duchess of Windsor who, around 1938, suggested to Renée Puissant, the Maison’s artistic director, a piece of jewelry inspired by the technological marvel that was the zipper. Eventually created in 1950, the Zip can be worn open as a necklace. The tassel, made of gold strands, can then slide up transforming the piece into a bracelet. This  creation is very characteristic of the main stylistic trends implemented by Van Cleef & Arpels through its couture theme and the multi-functional style. ",

The daring that typified 1970s fashion was also found in jewelry design. While precious stone jewelry remained the realm of the privileged few for whom <br/>Van Cleef & Arpels distinguished itself with brio, precious metal jewelry gradually broke free of traditional references to make its own mark. Transformable jewelry was more fashionable than ever: the necklace created for Prince Aga Khan in 1971 could be converted into a clip and bracelets."

Imperial symbols of the Chinese emperors, dragons were believed to ward off evil spirits. In ancient times, this animal was regarded as most sacred. It is also one of the most popular motifs in Chinese art: it is sculpted on the stone pillars of Chinese temples and embroidered on beautiful tapestries of silk and gold.This Dragon clip from 1969 is a magnificent tribute to the mythical Chinese animal. Created in a highly realistic style, it is portrayed as a long, scaled, serpentine creature with four legs. It is made of yellow gold, with emerald eyes.

            "Detail_content":"Combining a retrograde hour display and animation on demand, this creation provides the gaze with a dual spectacle. On the side of its ebony-colored base, a ladybird in Mystery Set rubies moves peacefully along the time scale. Reaching 12 o’clock, it returns to its starting point to begin its journey for the next half-day. When activated, the automaton comes to life for about 50 seconds, revealing a scene worthy of a fairy tale. First the water lily leaf begins to ripple, as if blown by a gentle breeze. Chimes ring out a crystalline melody and the water lily flower slowly blooms. The fairy awakes and raises her head to admire a butterfly at the center of the corolla: it rises into the air, beating its wings and twirling about. After moving simultaneously, the butterfly returns to its shelter, the fairy goes back to sleep and the water lily’s oscillation comes to an end.Forming the top of the Automate Fée Ondine, the large water lily leaf is made up of some 60 strips assembled together, which ripple during the animation. Engraved to suggest veins, they are also adorned with a gradation of green enamel and sprinkled with drops of dew. Small flowers and delicate lotuses in diamonds and pink sapphires complete the tableau.After imagining such an unprecedented piece in its history,<br />Van Cleef & Arpels enlisted the services of some 20 workshops in France and Switzerland, including holders of the Meilleur Ouvrier de France (Best Craftsman in France) and Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (Establishment of Living Heritage) titles. The experience of the automaton maker François Junod, based in Sainte-Croix in Switzerland, was complemented by that of lapidaries, jewelers, stone-setters, enamelers and cabinetmakers. The challenges were constant: miniaturizing the mechanism inside the fairy or shaping petals that were sufficiently light to be borne along by the movement, for example. Creating the Automate Fée Ondine called for the excellence of the most expert craftsmen in their respective fields.",
